# RNN-on-Dow-Jones-Index
Using keras to build a RNN

The model builds a simple RNN and trains it on the Dow Jones stock price. 
The takes in 30 days of information and then predicts one day into the future.
Using the day it has just predicted as information to then predict the next day, 
the goal of this model is to determine the trend of any numerical list.
